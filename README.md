Pop! Alerts // Arielle Chapin
===

Pop! is an alert replacement that directs attention to your message and brings a little pop to your site.
The default modals don't bring much focus; users will often click anything to make one go away before even reading the 
message. Pop! modals use a simple design and sleek transitions to make your alerts more accessible.

There are four possible alerts:<br />
1. "Message" alert<br />
2. "Error" alert<br />
3. "Confirm" alert<br />
4. "Success" alert<br />
